# Adversarial Separation Network for Cross-Network Node Classification
This repository contains the author's implementation in Pytorch for the paper "Adversarial Separation Network for Cross-Network Node Classification".


## Environment Requirement

* Python: 3.6

* PyTorch: 1.5.1 (with suitable CUDA and CuDNN version)

* tensorboard: 2.3.0

* Scipy:1.2.1

* Numpy:1.16.2

* sklearn:0.21.1


## Datasets:

The data folder includes different domain data. 

The preprocessed data can be found in our repository.

* `/data/acmv9.mat`

* `/data/dblpv7.mat`

* `/data/citationv1.mat`

The orginal datasets can be founded from https://www.aminer.cn/citation.


##  Training:

You can run the command in run.sh to train and evaluate on each task for network graph dataset. 

Before that, you need to change the data_root (data root path), learning rate and cuda (gpu options) in the script.

> python main.py --data_src 'dblpv7' --data_trg 'acmv9' --lr 3e-2 --cuda '0'
